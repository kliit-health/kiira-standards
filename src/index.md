# Kiira Health Engineering Standards

The Kiira Health Engineering standards are owned and maintained by the __engineers__. As an engineer, these standards exist for your benefit. The aspiration of this document is to give engineers new to Kiira a basic understanding of how engineering works here; the important aspects of how we write, test, deploy, and operate code.

## Expectations

- Everyone MUST follow the engineering standards.
- Anyone MAY propose changes to the engineering standards.
- Enginnering leaders MUST hold teams accountable to the engineering standards.
- Enginnering executives MAY grant exceptions to the engineering standards and MUST accept the risks that come with this.

## Usage

Here is how to use this document/site:

- All engineers working at Kiira Health should be aware of these standards and do their best to follow them.
- There is a Slack channel for comments, questions, and issues regarding the standards themselves, and this document. The Slack channel should be the first place to raise these concerns.
- The most up-to-date version of these standards will be published to GitHub Pages at https://kiira-health.github.io/kiira-standards.

## Compliance

Complying with these standards is the responsibility of everyone in the Kiira Health Engineering department.

## Contribute

See the [contributing guide](general-contributing.md) for detailed steps on how to contribute to the standards.

As an engineer, you are expected to not only comply with the standards, but also contribute.

- Upon finding something that needs to be added, updated, or removed, the contributor should author the change themselves and submit it as a pull request for review.
- Reviewers of standards contributions are responsible for the __quality__ and __maintenance__ of the standard itself.
